Dataset information
The dataset contains data from train and test datasets.
The script run_analysis.R first aims to merge these two datasets to create one data set.
The script then extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
It uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, and labels the data with these.
It then creates a second tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Output file
tidydata.txt
